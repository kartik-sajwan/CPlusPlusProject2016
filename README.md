This is my High School C++ project.

## About Us
This program has been developed by Kartik Sajwan.

## Overview
MAIN PROGRAM is a health management tool designed to help users monitor their health. Users can create customized profiles to record and track their food intake, particularly focusing on calorie consumption. The program stores this data, allowing users to search and review their intake history at any time. Additionally, it provides personalized physical activity suggestions based on the user’s eating habits and data.

## First Run
When the program is run for the first time, setup is initialized. If you're the system administrator, you can explore expert mode by entering a passphrase during setup. You’ll then be redirected to the manual page.

## Help & Tips
Password Rules: Passwords cannot contain special characters like !, @, #, etc., and '0' cannot be used as a username or password.
Backup: Restoring a backup will revert all changes to the calorie table, passphrase, user passwords, and account information. Regularly update your backup to prevent data loss.
Accurate Information: Provide accurate data to ensure precise health analysis and suggestions.
Automatic Backup: A backup of the calorie tables is created the first time the program is launched.
This README provides a clear introduction and usage guidelines for your program.
